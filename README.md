# About

The stock market is ever-changing and constantly fluctuating. This makes it
impossible for a person, even an expert, to predict. The Stock Analysis Application aims
to combat this problem. Our application will be used by traders and investors in order to
view predictions of directions of stock market prices for various companies.

The Stock Analysis Application provides an accurate indication on whether the price
of stock will rise or fall. It has features such as real   time data updates, predictions which
are evaluated daily and a list of many companies to choose from. The application is
intended to be user friendly and can be operated easily.
